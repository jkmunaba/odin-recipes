        <h2><em>Cooking Method</em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Wash the meat, trim the fat and chop into thick, medium-size cubes. Put the meat in a pan and boil in plenty of water with 1 tsp of salt.</p></li>
            <li><p>Meanwhile, finely chop the tomatoes, slice the onions and finely grate the garlic and ginger. 
                Slice the carrots into 1 cm thick slices. Peel the potatoes, wash and chop into quarters. 
                Keep the potatoes covered by water.</p></li>
            <li><p>When the meat is just cooked, drain, keep the water it was cooked in and put the meat aside.</p></li>
            <li><p>Heat the oil and fry the goat meat until brown.</p></li>   
            <li><p>Add the onions and continue frying for 1-2 mins. Add the curry powder and ginger and continue frying for about a minute.</p></li> 
            <li><p>Add the chopped tomatoes, stock cube and garlic. Cook, scraping the bottom of the pan until it is clear of all the bits that have stuck. 
                Add the Royco and cook, stirring until the sauce is a deep brown colour. Add the potatoes and the hot pepper, if using. Mix well. 
                Cover the pan and cook for about 5 mins.</p></li>
            <li><p>Pour in enough of the cooking water to just cover the potatoes. 
                Scrape the bottom of the pan, reduce the heat, cover the pan and cook until the potatoes are done, 
                adding more of the cooking liquid if necessary.</p></li>
            <li><p>Serve hot with your favourite staple and cooked vegetables.</p></li>
